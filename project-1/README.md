## üéØ Overview

This project is a simple Book Management API that allows users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a collection of books. It serves as an excellent introduction to:

- RESTful API design
- FastAPI framework
- HTTP methods and status codes
- Data validation with Pydantic
- API documentation

## ‚ú® Features

- **Get All Books**: Retrieve the complete list of books
- **Get Book by ID**: Find a specific book using its unique identifier
- **Search by Category**: Filter books by their category
- **Search by Author**: Find books by author name (supports partial matching)
- **Create New Book**: Add a new book to the collection
- **Update Book**: Modify existing book details
- **Delete Book**: Remove a book from the collection
- **Automatic API Documentation**: Interactive docs powered by Swagger UI and ReDoc

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**: Programming language
- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast web framework for building APIs
- **Pydantic**: Data validation using Python type annotations
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running the application

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Project

Download the project files to your local machine.

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Creating a virtual environment helps keep your project dependencies isolated.

```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

# Get book by ID
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/books/1

# Create a new book
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/books/" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title":"The Hobbit","author":"J.R.R. Tolkien","category":"Fantasy"}'

# Update a book
curl -X PUT "http://127.0.0.1:8000/books/1" \

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Port Already in Use

**Error:** `Address already in use`

**Solution:** Either kill the process using port 8000 or change the port:

```python
uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8001)
```

### Issue 2: Module Not Found

**Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`

**Solution:** Make sure you've installed the dependencies:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

### Issue 3: Cannot Access API from Other Devices

**Problem:** Want to access API from phone or another computer

**Solution:** Change host to `0.0.0.0`:

```python
uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

### Issue 4: Changes Not Reflecting

**Problem:** Code changes don't appear when testing

**Solution:** Make sure `reload=True` is set, or restart the server manually.

## üéØ Student Assignment: Enhance the Book Management API

Now that you've learned the basics of building a RESTful API, it's time to put your skills to the test! Complete the following assignments to deepen your understanding.

### Assignment Overview

You will enhance the existing Book Management API by adding new features, improving functionality, and implementing best practices. Choose assignments based on your comfort level.

---

### Level 1: Basic Enhancements (Beginner)

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

#### Task 1: Add More Book Attributes

Expand the book model to include additional fields:
- `publication_year` (integer)
- `isbn` (string, optional)
- `pages` (integer)
- `rating` (float, 0-5 scale)

**Requirements:**
- Update both `BookCreate` and `BookUpdate` models
- Add sample data with new fields
- Test all endpoints to ensure they work correctly

#### Task 2: Implement Search by Year Range

Create a new endpoint that allows searching for books published within a specific year range.

**Example:** `GET /books/year-range?start_year=1900&end_year=1950`

**Requirements:**
- Use query parameters for `start_year` and `end_year`
- Return all books within the specified range
- Handle cases where no books are found

#### Task 3: Add Pagination

Implement pagination for the "Get All Books" endpoint to handle large collections.

**Example:** `GET /books/?skip=0&limit=10`

**Requirements:**
- Add `skip` and `limit` query parameters
- Return only the specified number of books
- Set default values (skip=0, limit=10)

---

### Level 2: Intermediate Features (Intermediate)

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours

#### Task 4: Implement Data Persistence

Replace the in-memory list with persistent storage.

**Option A:** Use JSON file storage
- Create functions to save/load books from a JSON file
- Ensure data persists between server restarts

**Option B:** Use SQLite database (more advanced)
- Set up SQLAlchemy with SQLite
- Create proper database models
- Implement database CRUD operations

#### Task 5: Add Input Validation and Error Handling

Improve the API's robustness:
- Validate that book IDs are positive integers
- Ensure ISBN follows proper format (if implemented)
- Validate rating is between 0-5
- Prevent duplicate book IDs
- Return appropriate error messages for all validation failures

#### Task 6: Implement Sorting

Add the ability to sort books by different criteria.

**Example:** `GET /books/?sort_by=title&order=asc`

**Requirements:**
- Support sorting by: title, author, publication_year, rating
- Support both ascending and descending order
- Default to sorting by ID if not specified

---

### Level 3: Advanced Challenges (Advanced)

**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours

#### Task 7: Add User Authentication

Implement basic authentication for the API:
- Create a user registration endpoint
- Implement login with JWT tokens
- Protect certain endpoints (create, update, delete) - require authentication
- Allow anyone to read books (GET endpoints)

**Tools to Use:**
- `python-jose` for JWT
- `passlib` for password hashing
- `python-multipart` for form data

#### Task 8: Add Book Reviews System

Create a new feature for users to review books:
- Create a `Review` model with: user_id, book_id, rating, comment, date
- Add endpoints:
  - `POST /books/{book_id}/reviews` - Add a review
  - `GET /books/{book_id}/reviews` - Get all reviews for a book
  - `PUT /reviews/{review_id}` - Update a review
  - `DELETE /reviews/{review_id}` - Delete a review
- Calculate and display average rating for each book

#### Task 9: Implement Advanced Search

Create a comprehensive search endpoint with multiple filters:

**Example:** `GET /books/search?query=dystopian&category=Fiction&min_rating=4&max_year=2000`

**Requirements:**
- Support text search in title and author
- Filter by category, rating range, year range
- Combine multiple filters
- Return ranked results (best matches first)

#### Task 10: Add API Rate Limiting and Caching

Implement performance optimizations:
- Add rate limiting (e.g., 100 requests per minute per IP)
- Implement caching for frequently accessed endpoints
- Add request logging with timestamps
- Create a statistics endpoint showing API usage

---

### Bonus Challenge: Complete API Redesign üåü

Create a **Movie Management API** from scratch using everything you've learned:

**Requirements:**
- Movies should have: title, director, cast (list), genre, release_year, duration, rating
- Implement all CRUD operations
- Add advanced search and filtering
- Include user authentication
- Add a "watchlist" feature where users can save movies
- Implement movie recommendations based on genre preferences
- Add proper error handling and validation
- Write comprehensive API documentation
- Include unit tests for all endpoints
